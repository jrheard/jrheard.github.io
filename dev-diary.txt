ok god this sucks

so in commit 2040ca73f724474b995e8de47e985366131154fc

i start using this javascript tag
to try to cachebust i guess

ugh

i'm seriously considering spending the next 2 days rewriting this in python
i could spend a couple hours tomorrow seeing what the scope of the project is
could even make gh issues and stuff

i'd have to figure out what the best python templating library is
and implement cachebusting (should be easy)

and the real test will be to run a whitespace-insensitive diff against the static files

one of the scariest things is that my posts drop between html and markdown back and forth all the time

maybe that's just standard markdown behavior? no clue

i guess i could start with the jobs post and go from there

TODO use poetry instead of pipenv?

5/26/24

ok for a bit i was going to start writing a new blog thing from scratch

but let's try one more time to resurrect the old blog first
i was gonna play around w gh copilot too just for fun/learning

ok
where to start

i kinda wanna reset everything - wipe the gemfile.lock and set my asdf to ruby 3
and remove the jekyll assets plugin
and then try to get the site to build

gonna have to start by converting the javascript liquid tags to something else
what did i have before that commit?

ok it looks like i had this in my _includes/head.html

	  {% if page.custom_js %}
		{% for js_file in page.custom_js %}
		<script src='{{site.baseurl}}/public/js/{{ js_file }}.js' type="text/javascript"></script>
		{% endfor %}
	  {% endif %}

and for one-offs i did this

    <script src="{{ site.baseurl}}/public/js/klipse.js"></script>

TODO if i update to jekyll 4 i'll need to update my post_url tags i think

ok i made a lot of progress
fixed all the jekyll-assets tags to not totally break the build
now it builds

but i want to play around with it and see the million ways in which links/etc will be broken

i'm trying to rsync the built staging site to my linode
but i can't get perms set up to write to /var/www/html as jrheard
i tried adding myself to a group and adding the group to that dir
but no dice so far

i was able to use setfacl but not chown

oh i think i see

[jrheard@localhost:~] ðŸš‚  sudo ls -ld  /var/www/html
drwxrwxr-x+ 5 root webadmin 4096 May 26 11:53 /var/www/html
[jrheard@localhost:~] ðŸš‚  ls -ld  /var/www/html
drwxrwxr-x+ 5 root 4096 May 26 11:53 /var/www/html

ok whatever

upgrading my linode bc why not

Continue running under SSH?

This session appears to be running under ssh. It is not recommended
to perform a upgrade over ssh currently because in case of failure it
is harder to recover.

If you continue, an additional ssh daemon will be started at port
'1022'.
Do you want to continue?

Continue [yN] y

Starting additional sshd

To make recovery in case of failure easier, an additional sshd will
be started on port '1022'. If anything goes wrong with the running
ssh you can still connect to the additional one.
If you run a firewall, you may need to temporarily open this port. As
this is potentially dangerous it's not done automatically. You can
open the port with e.g.:
'iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1022 -j ACCEPT'

To continue please press [ENTER]


TODO do i need to set nginx to run automatically at startup?

oh god there's ANOTHER os upgrade i can do

gonna do it again bc i'm a fool

i had just upgraded to focal, now upgrading to jammy
do i need to upgrade to noble next???

ok guess not

but now i see this when i start tmux

/home/jrheard/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/home/.tmux.conf:34: invalid option: status-attr                                                                                                      [0/0]

do i need to do something special to set up my status bar tmux thingy?
does it need to be upgraded?

https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1689

ok i messed with status now i get this one

/home/jrheard/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/home/.tmux.conf:35: invalid option: window-status-fg                                                                                                 [0/0]

ok progress i guess

ok made a ton more progress

blog-staging is timing out

http://45.33.63.145/ works

fine

so on staging, http://45.33.63.145/roguelike still doesn't work, needs to be http://45.33.63.145/roguelike.html
should i just update all my links? or is there some way to get /roguelike to work on both nginx and github pages?

ok sick this works

              try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;

copilot claims that my gh pages blog will automatically do the same thing
cool

i also changed my nginx server_name to blog-staging.jrheard.com
we'll see if that helps anything

ok!!!!

so where are we at now?

i can build my site for staging like this

    asdf exec bundle exec jekyll build  --watch --config _config.yml,_config_staging.yml

i can rsync it to staging like this

    rsync -avz --no-t --no-perms /Users/jrheard/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/dev/blog/_staging/ jrheard@sandbox:/var/www/html/

TODO make helpful commands for those things
someday i need to revisit my dotfiles setup...

ok
next up, poke around on staging, find broken stuff, fix it

my js links seem to be broken

<script src="/public/js/asciinema-player.js"></script>

i need to replace public/ with assets/ just about everywhere

ok cool
ran into an issue when rsyncing
but recursively chmodding /var/www/html to 775 again fixed it
i think the issue is that the python dir didn't exist when i chmodded that dir in the first place

so i had to chmod the python dir in that dir tree

anyway cool now rsync works
and the public->assets thing seems to have worked!

ok cool we're getting there

what else?

blog posts are looking good overall

gotta check the python projects and other stuff in the sidebar next

they all look good
friggin sweet

let's look at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/3-to-4/

i was on jekyll 2 i think last time

doesn't look like 2->3 broke anything i care about

3->4 changed post_url

ok cool done

let's poke at staging a bit

i want to get the domain working

and then i want a banner and a robots.txt

ok the issue with the blog-staging subdomain is that i was trying to access it at https://
http was working but i hadn't set up https yet

so i followed the lets encrypt / certbot instructions
and now have ssl set up on that subdomain!!!! so cool!!!

now i want to set up a robots.txt to noindex my staging site

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12062766/jekyll-use-config-yml-values-in-the-html

i just went ahead and added one manually in /var/www/html
rysnc doesn't delete files by default
just tested an rsync invocation and it left the robots.txt intact
done!

and i fixed my banner!
done with that too!

all that's left is cachebusting js!
and i think i'm done with that too!!

what's left?

having nice aliases/commands for building and uploading to staging would be good
and it can't hurt to try triggering a publish, and make a command for that too

ok i made a couple commands
and fixed an issue in rake publish re main vs master default branch

and deployed to prod

gonna have to wait a few minutes for prod caching to catch up i think

DONE i'll know the new version is live when my cachebusting system is visibly different in page source

it worked!!!

one really clear lesson i'm learning from all this is that i shouldn't link to external images bc gif sites keep going down!

lol oh shit my blog index is empty
what's that about??

this talks about "all my posts are gone"
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/2-to-3/

i notice the pagination plugin is saying not to set a permalink

and i have this in _config.yml

permalink:           /:title

but when i comment that out, my posts live at urls like https://blog-staging.jrheard.com/2019/06/15/roguelike.html

which i don't like

what if i remove the pagination plugin for now?

yeah that fixed it!!

ok cool

i'm still curious about what a python blog generator could look like though
the main open question rn is markdown parsing
my jekyll blog uses kramdown
which is a superset of markdown?
do i need a python lib to do that too? are those available?
what is kramdown?

so far i can't see anything in kramdown that i need that isn't in markdown
i want to do a side by side comparison of kramdown parsing vs python lib parsing on one of my posts' markdown
first i have to pick a python lib

looks like there are four options
mistletoe
marko
markdown
mistune

marko has no stars to speak of
mistletoe low stars
markdown and mistune decent stars

i'm inclined to go with markdown, it's old but still getting frequent updates

ok the kramdown ruby lib is doing some weird selective escaping of certain characters
and i can't figure out how to get it to stop
so that makes doing a diff a bit difficult
but it looks like it generates the same output as the python markdown lib overall
which is interesting!!

so i think if i wanted to, i could write a python blog app after all :)
we'll see!!!

now i'm wishing i didn't trash that TODO file
did i keep it on another branch?

yes i did!
here's what it had:

	jotting down some features so i don't forget them
	    * cache busting
	    * there are a bunch of assorted files at the root dir of the git repo, they seem to get moved to the output dir wholesale -
			i'll prob want to put these in a different dir in the git repo for sanity?
	    * drafts
	    * staging site gets draft, live site doesn't
	    * theme - just unapologetically steal lanyon html+css(+js? is there any?) with credit
	    * rss feed
	    * switching back and forth between markdown and html - apparently i use kramdown? does regular markdown do this? is there a kra
	down equivalent for python?

	other stuff
	    * gh actions for tests + mypy
	    * mypy vscode extension
	    * dependabot?
	    * poetry?
		* precommit?
		* pydantic? not sure what i'd even be validating but worth keeping in mind i guess
		* pytest or unittest? prob unittest for the sake of time, could always convert later to see what that's like
	    * what else?

cool cool

so in all the upgrades yesterday my taskwarrior on my linode got upgraded to 2.6.1
but my taskwarrior on my rpi is 2.5.1
and they disagree with what to show when running task on the same data dir
so i'm trying to build and install taskwarrior 2.6.1 on my rpi

first i'm going through the INSTALL file and installing all the deps it lists
DONE gotta uninstall taskwarrior 2.5.1 via apt

  $ tar xzf task-X.Y.Z.tar.gz                   [1]
  $ cd task-X.Y.Z                               [2]
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release .          [3]
  $ make                                        [4]
  $ sudo make install                           [5]
  $ cd .. ; rm -r task-X.Y.Z                    [6]

that worked :)

ok that doesn't have anything to do with the blog but whatever
it was helpful to take notes somewhere
ok gonna poke at frankly now

nvm actually
i played around with setting the repo up for a few hours and that was fun
but the idea of reimplementing jekyll actually sounds a lot less fun now that i know it's a waste of time
so nvm!
